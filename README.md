# Using AWS X-Ray with Amazon EventBridge

This example application shows how to use AWS X-Ray with Amazon EventBridge, using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).

To learn more about how this sample works, see AWS Compute Blog post: TBD

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - minimum version 0.48.
* [NodeJS 12.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation Instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

1. Clone the repo onto your local development machine using `git clone`.

1. Change into the repo's directory.

## Deploy the webhook

1. Run:

```
cd ./webhook
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```
When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: eventbridge-xray-webhook
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Accept all other defaults.

2. Note the API endpoint created by the template.

3. Test the API webhook using [curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). The endpoint accepts a query parameter that is stored in the event before being put on the event bus. The following query parameter options are valid:

- Routes to the Lambda consumer: https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod?target=lambda
- Routes to the Step Functions consumer: https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod?target=sfn
- Routes to an API Gateway consumer: https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod?target=apigw

## Deploy and test the Lambda consumer

1. Run:

```
cd ./targets-lambda
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```
When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: eventbridge-xray-target-lambda
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Accept all other defaults.

2. Route an event to the Lambda consumer by using curl or Postman to invoke the webhook:

- https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod?target=lambda

3. Open the [X-Ray console](console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home), select *Traces* from the menu, and select the most recent trace to view the the request from webhook through to Lambda.

## Deploy and test the Step Functions consumer

1. Run:

```
cd ./targets-sfn
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```
When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: eventbridge-xray-target-step-functions
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Accept all other defaults.

2. Route an event to the Lambda consumer by using curl or Postman to invoke the webhook:

- https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod?target=sfn

3. Open the [X-Ray console](console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home), select *Traces* from the menu, and select the most recent trace to view the the request from webhook through to Step Functions.

## Create a Lambda layer with the X-Ray SDK

You can create a Lambda layer containing the X-Ray SDK, making it easier to add the SDK to existing Lambda functions:

1. Run:

```
cd ./aws-xray-sdk-layer
npm install
mkdir ./layer/nodejs –p
mv ./node_modules ./layer/nodejs
```
1.	Next, deploy the AWS SAM template to create the layer:
sam deploy --guided

When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: AWS SDK layer
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Accept all other defaults.

1.	After the deployment completes, the new Lambda layer is available to use. Run this command to see the available layers:

```
aws lambda list-layers
```

## Next steps

The AWS Compute Blog post at the top of this README file contains additional information about the how to use Lambda layers.
